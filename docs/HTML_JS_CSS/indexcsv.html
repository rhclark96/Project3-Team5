          <p> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/COVID-19.pdf">COVID-19 vaccines</a> help prevent severe illness and infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
            Vaccines help the body learn how to fight the virus before becoming infected, preventing more severe symptoms such as trouble breathing and chest pains.</p>
          <p> Vaccines and immunizations also help to develop <b>herd immunity</b>, in which more individuals being vaccinated helps to prevent the spread of disease. 
            In more populated areas, this is especially important as people are coming into contact more often than in rural areas. 
            Vaccines are an integral part of creating herd immunity. 
            The more people that are vaccinated in a community, the more that every member of that communtiy is protected from infection. </p>
            <p>While many people these days have recieved their initial set of COVID-19 vaccinations, it is highly reccomended to get booster vaccinations every year, similar to the flu shot.
              This will not only help the body "remember" how to fight the virus, but also protect against new varients of the virus.
            For more information on COVID-19 vaccines, please visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/index.html">CDC COVID-19 vaccines website</a>. </p>
