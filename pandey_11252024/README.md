# Project title: COVID-19 vaccination provider locations.

## Overview: The main objective of our project was to help public find COVID-19 vaccination provider locations. 


## Usage instructions
Broadly, the cluster and marker map provides number of locations in a city. Users can zoom in to narrow the area and find the vaccine provider locations near their neighborhood.

Each location is marked with a marker. Marker popup has information about the providerâ€™s name, phone number, address as well as the website. Users can get more information about the location through the website and make the appointments as well.
The map has dropdown menu to locate the providers which have vaccine in-stock and the locations which accepts insurance.

Users can also search for a nearby vaccine provider location by zipcode.

The map can be further enhanced by providing more information, like types of vaccines available at a location, even though we decided not to include such information to keep map less crowded and visually appealing.

## Ethical considerations
This dataset is from a public source (CDC, DHHS) and did not have any personal information. 
Data analyses indicated that the urban centers had relatively higher density of vaccine providers compared to the rural areas. Our suggestion is to increase the number of locations in rural areas to enable easy access to COVID-19 vaccines.
